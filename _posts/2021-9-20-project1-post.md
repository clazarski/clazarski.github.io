Blog Once you’ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post: • explaining what you did in the project and any interesting findings • You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like: – what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you? – what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future? • In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo and the usual repo as well! The URL to this (rendered) blog post is what you will submit at the project assignment link
