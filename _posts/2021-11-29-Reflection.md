•	what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do

My impression regarding the role of communication that is involved for a data scientist has changed. My prior perception was that a data scientist would spend the majority of their time working on analyses and finding models but my impression now is it is much more about understanding a problem, interrogating a customer to understand better the context, and to present findings in a meaningful way. The analyses is a critical but much smaller role than I had previously understood.

•	what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

YesI love the opportunities that using R provides but hate my inability to use it more effectively. While I feel my knowledge has broadened, I still do not feel comfortable doing many things and don’t really understand the process R uses to do what it does. While there are tons of forums to find help, everyone seems to do something differently and I wonder what the most efficient/effective method is for completing a task. I will continue to use R, learn more about it, and hopefully reduce my frustration in the process.

•	what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

I will employ more of the tidyverse functions in my work now that I am aware of them. I want to continue to work on developing shinyapps for exploring statistical ideas. I will also work on using RMarkdown as a tool for presenting analyses and communication. Prior to this course I was not very comfortable with RMarkdown but feel much more confident using it and find it to be an effective tool for delivering content. I might even go nuts and try and use an API to gather data.
