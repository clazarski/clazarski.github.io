What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

Being a data scientist is about problem solving. A data scientist needs to be able to listen to a client and understand the question being posed. They need to take that question and use available data resources to create an analysis. Finally, they must present their findings in such a way that the client is able to interpret and implement them effectively. 

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

A data scientist must first be able to communicate. They need to be able to interpret a clientâ€™s needs and communicate their results. Being able to create a solution requires knowledge of statistics, programming, and real-world expertise. 

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

Both data scientists and statisticians use and apply statistics to tackle real world problems. A data scientist may focus more on creating predictive models to help a client make decisions through the use of machine learning algorithms, whereas, a statistician may focus more on understanding the relationships between the different variables in a context and how the theoretical foundations of modeling those variables can be improved by applying statistical methods to the problem. Both fields can work towards answering the same problem but may approach it with different tools and methods, however, those tools and methods are all based on a statistical foundation.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I am more on the statistician side of this equation with a strong interest in developing my data scientist side.
