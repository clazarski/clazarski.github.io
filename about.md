### Professional Interests
My professional career has been spent working at the high school level in both public and private schools. My focus has been on developing innovative curriculum for teaching statistics. I am currently working on my Master's in Statistics at North Carolina State University and have been incorporating expertise I am developing into my curriculum. In collaboration with Kristi Ramey, we are adapting the course work material towards developing a new course at the high school level that teaches introductory statistics at the Calculus level.
